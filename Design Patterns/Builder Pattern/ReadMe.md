This is a simple example of the builder pattern. This is the C# version of a demo
given from Derek Banas on YouTube. This is to demonstrate my knowledge and experience
of the Builder design pattern.

The reason/use case for this pattern is to ensure the following:
    1) Ensure the separation of sub components and main component.
    2) Create less dependency for the client, so only the main component knows the dependency.
    3) Only have the main component know the specifics and keep a simple interface for the client.
